## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (WHAT YOU NEED TO DO)

### Step 1: Run the Model in Google Colab (20 minutes)
1. Open `model/model_building.ipynb`
2. Copy all cells to Google Colab
3. Run cells sequentially
4. This will generate:
   - `breast_cancer_model.pkl`
   - `scaler.pkl`
5. Download these files

### Step 2: Test Locally (10 minutes)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
# Test in browser at http://localhost:8501
```

### Step 3: Create GitHub Repository (15 minutes)
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create repo: `BreastCancer_Project_OgahVictor_22CG031902`
3. Push all files to GitHub
4. Make sure it's PUBLIC

### Step 4: Deploy on Render (15 minutes)
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Create Web Service from GitHub
3. Follow DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.txt
4. Get your live URL

### Step 5: Update & Submit (10 minutes)
1. Update `BreastCancer_hosted_webGUI_link.txt` with links
2. Create final ZIP package
3. Submit to Scorac before 11:59 PM Jan 22

**Total Time:** ~70 minutes for complete deployment

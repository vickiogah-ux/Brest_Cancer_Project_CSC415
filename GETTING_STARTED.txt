## 🎯 TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK REFERENCE

### Problem: "ModuleNotFoundError"
```bash
# Solution: Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Problem: "Model not found"
```
✓ Verify model/breast_cancer_model.pkl exists
✓ Check file path in app.py
✓ Ensure .pkl files are in GitHub
```

### Problem: App doesn't start
```bash
# Check syntax
python -m py_compile app.py

# Run with error details
streamlit run app.py --logger.level=debug
```

### Problem: Slow on Render
```
✓ Normal on first request (free tier)
✓ Cache will speed up subsequent requests
✓ Wait 10-30 seconds for first load
```

### Problem: Features out of range
```
✓ Check slider min/max values
✓ Verify training data ranges
✓ Use realistic values
```

---

## 📊 EXPECTED RESULTS

### When Model Trains (Colab)
```
✓ Dataset loaded: 569 samples
✓ Features selected: 5
✓ Data split: 455 train, 114 test
✓ Model trained successfully
✓ Test Accuracy: ~96-97%
✓ Models saved: .pkl files created
```

### When App Runs (Local)
```
✓ Streamlit initializes
✓ Models load from disk
✓ UI renders correctly
✓ Sliders respond to input
✓ Predictions appear instantly
```

### When Deployed (Render)
```
✓ Build completes: "Build successful"
